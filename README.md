# Grocery-Application
# SPSGP-72595-Virtual-Internship---Android-Application-Development-Using-Kotlin


## Abstract  
There has been an extraordinary growth all around the world regarding android applications. People from every age group are using an android application for some reason or the other. Internet and applications have become a huge thing now. Companies have realized its potential and that it can reach the concerned consumers of any business. One of the primary reasons of people turning towards technology is that it makes their lives easier. One of the areas of real potential is online grocery shopping. When we talk about shopping, people usually find it tedious to stand in a queue for hours or find their products around a supermarket.

### Objective:
The main objective of the project is to manage the details of grocery, customer, order, product. The main purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the grocery, customer, address, order. It tracks all the deatils about the order, product.

### Technologies used
#### 1. MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
MVVM architecture in android is used to give structure to the project’s code and understand code easily. MVVM is an architectural design pattern in android. MVVM treat Activity classes and XML files as View. This design pattern completely separate UI from its logic. Here is an image to quickly understand MVVM.  
#### 2. ROOM DataBase
Room persistence library is a database management library and it is used to store the data of apps like grocery item name, grocery item quantity, and grocery item price. Room is a cover layer on SQLite which helps to perform the operation on the database easily.
#### 3. RecycleView
RecyclerView is a container and it is used to display the collection of data in a large amount of data set that can be scrolled very effectively by maintaining a limited number of views.
#### 4. Coroutines
Coroutines are a lightweight thread, we use a coroutine to perform an operation on other threads, by this our main thread doesn’t block and our app doesn’t crash. 
#### 5. Kotlin
Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio. Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.
#### 6. Android Studio
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.

### Conclusion
As they say it is imperative that we move along with time, move along with the trend and try to make the world a better and efficient place to live in. As the years go by there will be many more grocery applications and the real grocery stores might eventually shut down. If you look at it these applications save a lot of time, they save a lot of energy and
they do even save some money. This is the future of Online Shopping. Our aim was to develop an user friendly application.
